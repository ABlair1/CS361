    <h3>How Are The Food Footprints Calculated? </h3>
    <p>
        The total emissions produced by each item account for land use 
        changes, feed (for animals), farming operations, processing, 
        transportation, packaging, and retail operations (Nemecek & 
        Poore, 2018). Follow the link in the citation below to read 
        the peer reviewed research that supports the Food Footprint 
        Calculator.
